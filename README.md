# Image Classification using CNN
 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes[4] in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.

Provided CNN model will classify the particular animal (Dog or Cat) from the dataset containing images of Dogs and Cats.

Dataset:
I have used publicly available dataset, you can find the same from bellow link (uploaded on google drive).
download the dataset and unzip it keep it in same directory structure.
